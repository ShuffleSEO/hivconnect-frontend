# HIV Service Landscape Analysis: Central New Jersey

HIV Connect Central NJ operates within a complex ecosystem of HIV services across Middlesex, Somerset, and Hunterdon counties, but significant gaps exist between current coordination efforts and the full spectrum of available resources. This analysis reveals a robust network of Ryan White-funded services alongside numerous uncoordinated providers, creating both opportunities and challenges for comprehensive HIV care delivery in the region.

## Current provider network shows geographic imbalance

HIV Connect Central NJ currently coordinates **8 detailed provider locations** despite claiming collaboration with "over a dozen providers." The network demonstrates **heavy concentration in Middlesex County**, particularly New Brunswick, while Somerset and Hunterdon counties remain significantly underserved.

**Middlesex County leads with 6 providers**: The Eric B. Chandler Health Center, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School AIDS Program, RWJ Dental Clinic, CVS MinuteClinic, Elijah's Promise, and a New Brunswick Planned Parenthood location provide comprehensive services ranging from HIV treatment and testing to dental care and nutrition services. The Visiting Nurse Association offers county-wide home-based case management, while Perth Amboy hosts an additional Planned Parenthood location.

**Somerset County coverage remains minimal** with only Somerset Treatment Services in Somerville providing substance abuse treatment, psychiatric care, and HIV case management. **Hunterdon County shows the most severe gap** with just one Planned Parenthood location in Flemington offering STD testing and treatment services.

This geographic imbalance becomes particularly concerning given that all three counties are served by the same Ryan White Transitional Grant Area, suggesting coordination challenges rather than funding limitations.

## Ryan White Program provides comprehensive foundation across all parts

New Jersey's Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program delivers extensive services through all four program parts, creating a robust safety net for HIV care across the three-county region. **Part A services** through the Newark Eligible Metropolitan Area cover Essex, Union, Morris, Sussex, and Warren counties, while Middlesex, Somerset, and Hunterdon counties receive **dual coverage** through both Newark EMA coordination and local Middlesex County administration.

**Part B state-administered services** include the AIDS Drug Distribution Program providing free medications to individuals up to 500% of Federal Poverty Level, plus Health Insurance Premium Payment assistance. The NJ Department of Health operates these programs statewide with 24/7 hotline support.

**Part C early intervention services** operate through key providers including Zufall Health Center (serving all three target counties), Saint Michael's Medical Center in Newark, and the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey. These programs offer comprehensive HIV testing, counseling, medical case management, and linkage to care services specifically designed for newly diagnosed individuals.

**Part D services for women, infants, children, and youth** operate through the NJ Statewide Family Centered HIV Care Network with **no income requirements**, providing family-centered comprehensive care coordination. Program Manager Kourtney Pulliam at (609) 777-7778 oversees services across all counties.

The Ryan White system creates **multiple entry points** with Part A emergency assistance, Part B medication access, Part C community health center services, and Part D family services, ensuring comprehensive coverage regardless of diagnosis timing or family status.

## Significant provider gaps exist beyond current network

Research identified **numerous HIV service providers** in the three-county region not currently integrated into HIV Connect Central NJ's coordination system. **Zufall Health** emerges as a particularly significant gap - this FQHC operates multiple locations across Somerset County including Somerville, Franklin Township, and Bridgewater, plus Plainsboro in Middlesex County, offering comprehensive HIV testing, treatment, PrEP, dental care, and case management services to over 48,000 patients annually.

**RWJBarnabas Health System** operates comprehensive HIV/AIDS programs across all three counties through Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset and multiple primary care locations. Their services include HIV testing, treatment, education, counseling, and case management with nationally certified coordinators and multilingual support in 11 languages.

**Hospital system integration** represents a major coordination opportunity. Atlantic Health System offers HIV testing and PrEP services with extended hours in nearby Morris County, while multiple Planned Parenthood locations beyond those currently listed provide HIV testing and PrEP counseling throughout the region.

**Community health centers** including additional FQHC locations, county health departments offering testing and surveillance services, and specialized AIDS service organizations like Hyacinth AIDS Foundation provide extensive services not reflected in current coordination efforts.

The analysis revealed **minimal telehealth integration** despite significant post-COVID expansion of remote HIV services, including 24/7 PrEP initiation through platforms like NYU Langone Virtual Urgent Care and Planned Parenthood telehealth services.

## Service categories reveal comprehensive but fragmented landscape

The region offers extensive HIV services across all major categories, but coordination challenges create barriers to access. **Medical care** includes HIV specialty treatment through Hyacinth AIDS Foundation's 8 statewide centers, RWJBarnabas Health's comprehensive HIV program, and VNA Health Group's home-based case management serving Middlesex and Somerset counties specifically.

**Case management services** operate through multiple models including Hyacinth's medical and non-medical case management at various locations, VNA Health Group's registered nurse assessments and care coordination, and Community VNA's home care services specifically for Somerset and Middlesex counties.

**Mental health services** include Hyacinth's Wellness Community offering individual and group counseling with licensed therapists, RWJBarnabas social workers trained in family therapy and substance abuse, and NJCRI's psychiatric support services. **Substance abuse treatment** operates through Hyacinth's licensed programs in Paterson and Newark, plus Buddies of New Jersey's certified counseling services.

**Housing assistance** includes federal HOPWA programs administered through the NJ Department of Health, Hyacinth's housing placement assistance in Newark and New Brunswick, Community Hope's veteran family services covering all three counties, and Catholic Charities' specialized HIV housing facilities.

**Transportation, food assistance, legal services, insurance enrollment, and emergency financial assistance** all operate through multiple providers with varying eligibility requirements and service areas. The **NJ AIDS Drug Distribution Program** provides free HIV medications statewide through any Medicaid-eligible pharmacy for individuals up to 500% of Federal Poverty Level.

**Prevention services** include comprehensive HIV testing through state-funded sites, PrEP services through multiple providers, and specialized programs like VNA Health Group's Prevention Resource Network serving Middlesex and Somerset counties specifically.

## Best practices analysis reveals major improvement opportunities

Comparative analysis of leading HIV resource websites identifies significant enhancement opportunities for HIV Connect Central NJ. **Chicago HIV Resource Hub** demonstrates best-in-class coordination through online portals enabling client account creation, emergency assistance applications, and multi-channel access with extended hours. Their collaborative model between AIDS Foundation Chicago and Center on Halsted creates seamless service integration.

**New York AIDS Institute Provider Directory** showcases advanced functionality with comprehensive search filters by service type, location, specialization, and geographic area. Real-time database updates ensure accuracy while clear specialization indicators help clients identify appropriate providers.

**Technology gaps** in HIV Connect Central NJ include absence of provider directory functionality, appointment scheduling integration, mobile optimization, educational resource libraries, and telehealth service coordination. Leading sites demonstrate interactive mapping, risk assessment tools, patient portals, and multilingual content delivery.

**Immediate improvement priorities** should include implementing searchable provider directories with filtering capabilities, mobile optimization enhancements, and basic appointment scheduling integration. **Medium-term goals** involve developing comprehensive resource libraries, service locator mapping with GPS integration, and patient portal systems for service applications.

**Long-term innovation opportunities** include data visualization of regional HIV surveillance, telehealth platform integration, community engagement features, and API connections with major EMR systems for seamless referral coordination.

## Conclusion

Central New Jersey's HIV service landscape reveals extensive resources operating through Ryan White Programs Parts A-D alongside numerous community providers, but coordination challenges create artificial barriers to comprehensive care. HIV Connect Central NJ's current network represents only a fraction of available services, with particular gaps in Somerset and Hunterdon county representation and minimal telehealth integration.

The region's **dual Ryan White coverage** through Newark EMA and Middlesex County administration creates unique coordination opportunities, while providers like Zufall Health, RWJBarnabas Health System, and multiple FQHCs offer comprehensive services currently outside the coordination network. **Technology enhancement** following best practices from Chicago, New York, and national models could transform service access and coordination effectiveness.

Success requires expanding provider partnerships beyond the current 8 detailed locations, implementing advanced website functionality for service coordination, and developing systematic integration with hospital systems, FQHCs, and telehealth platforms to create truly comprehensive HIV care coordination across all three counties.
