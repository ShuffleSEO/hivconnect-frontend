## FAQ Section Copy

### Common Questions with Inclusive Answers

**"Will my information be kept private?"**
```
Absolutely. All HIV-related services are strictly confidential. Your information is protected by federal and state privacy laws. We only share information with your written permission or as required by law. You control who knows about your care.
```

**"What if I don't have insurance?"**
```
Most of our services are available regardless of insurance status. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provides funding for HIV care for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Many providers offer sliding scale fees based on your ability to pay.
```

**"What if I'm undocumented?"**
```
Immigration status doesn't affect your ability to receive HIV care and support services. All services are confidential, and providers don't report to immigration authorities. Your health and safety are our only concerns.
```

**"What if I'm not ready to tell anyone about my HIV status?"**
```
That's completely understandable and your choice to make. You can access many services without disclosing your status to anyone in your personal life. Your case manager can help you think through disclosure when and if you're ready.
