1.3.2 To set service priorities and make allocations of grant funds;

1.3.3 To assess the efficiency of the administrative mechanism to efficiently and effectively  distribute Part A and MAI grant awards and assure quality services;

1.3.4 To develop standards for improving the delivery of services as part of the local planning  processes;

1.3.5 To assure community participation in needs assessment and non-conflicted community  participation in priority setting;

ARTICLE XI
Grievance, Grievance Procedures and Conflict of Interest
11.1 Grievances, Grievance Procedures

The Council has procedures for addressing grievances with respect to funding under this part  section, including procedures for submitting grievances and successive stages of the process up to  binding arbitration. These procedures are consistent with state and local laws (also see Article V,  Section 5.2.4 for those duties of the Executive Committee related to grievances and Appendix I,  “Grievance Procedures”).

11.1.1 For purposes of these bylaws, a grievance is a formal expression of dissatisfaction, in  writing, about some aspect of the Planning Council’s processes, decisions that were  implemented or other Council actions or activities, which is brought to the attention of  the Planning Council’s administrative designee as having some responsibility for receiving  grievances. Dissatisfaction with or among Planning Council members will follow the  internal complaint process (Section 11.2) before being considered under grievance  procedures. The grievance must be in writing in order to be considered by the Executive  Committee.

11.1.2 A grievance procedure is a formal, structured mechanism, which enables an individual or  entity to express dissatisfaction about some aspect of the Planning Council’s processes,  decisions that were implemented or other Council actions or activities, to the Planning  Council’s administrative designee, in writing, a fair and impartial assessment and decision  regarding the complaint.

11.2 Internal Complaint

Complaints or issues regarding the conduct of individual Planning Council members shall follow such  policies and procedures as the Council may from time to time establish. The Executive Committee  shall have the responsibility of ensuring that all such issues or complaints are managed in accordance  with the established procedures and are resolved. The Executive Committee shall have authority to  carry out such actions as are deemed, by it, to be appropriate to resolve the complaint up to and  including a recommendation to the Freeholder Director requesting removal of a member. Due to the  confidential nature of such complaints, these matters shall not be presented to the full Council at an  open meeting. Dissatisfaction with or among Planning Council members will follow the internal  complaint process (see appendices) before being considered under grievance procedure.

11.3 Conflict of Interest

The Council has established a conflict-of-interest policy which is enforceable and consistent with state  and local laws (also see Article V, Section 5.2.4, for those duties of the Executive Committee related  to conflict of interest).

11.3.1 For purposes of these bylaws, a conflict of interest is an actual or perceived interest, financial  or otherwise, by a member in an action which results, or has the appearance of resulting, in  personal, organizational (programmatic and service category), or professional gain. Actual bias  or the appearance thereof in the decision-making process is based upon the dual role of a member who, in addition to serving on the Council, may be affiliated with other organizations,  either as an employee, a consultant, an employer, a member, or in some other (decision making) capacity.

11.3.2 At the time of a proposed vote on any matter, a “financial interest” in a service category is  defined as the receipt of any combination of stipends, honoraria, gifts, wages, salaries or any  other payment with a total value in excess of four thousand dollars ($4,000) from one or any  combination of service providers within said service category over a period either (1) from the  date of the proposed vote back to the time of the ratification of this clause or (2) from the date  of the proposed vote back over the previous 12 months, whichever is shorter. Payments  received before the ratification of this clause will not be considered a conflict of interest.

11.3.3 A member may serve on the Planning Council only if the individual agrees that, if they have a  financial interest in an agency, or if they are an employee of (or serves in a decision-making  capacity upon) a private or public agency or organization, and such agency or organization is  seeking funds from a grant, that they will not participate by vote in any process of selecting  entities to receive such funds for such services or purposes.

11.3.4 Council members will submit a completed (signed) affidavit stating that they understand and  will adhere to this policy.

11.3.5 Additionally, the Executive Committee will establish and distribute to Planning Council  members a written statement of rules and guidelines which stipulate that a member may be  recommended for removal from the Council if they refuse to submit a conflict-of-interest form  and/or it is determined that the member knowingly included misinformation on the disclosure  form, and/or it is determined that the member attempted to influence the Council during its  deliberation in the conduct of its business while knowing it was a conflict of interest either by  misrepresentation of information and/or authority, and/or refuses to cooperate in a conflict-of-interest review.

11.3.6 The Executive Committee is the sole and final arbiter of what constitutes an actual or perceived conflict of interest.

Appendix I – Grievance Policy and Procedures
Planning Council Grievance Policy and Procedures
Policy Statement  

It shall be the policy of the Planning Council to attempt to resolve grievances regarding the  Planning Council processes through informal dispute mechanisms, including appropriate use of  Planning Council subcommittees and facilitated mediation. The Planning Council Chair, Vice Chair, Service Standards and Integrated Care Chair, Membership and Bylaws Chair, Watch Dogs Chair, Our Voices Chair, and Support Staff shall attempt to informally resolve disputes by  providing information to or arranging meetings with entities dissatisfied with adherence to  Planning Council processes. Grievants are expected to cooperate with the Planning Council in  efforts to resolve the disagreement before formal grievance procedures are pursued.  

Eligible Grievances  

A challenge to the Planning Council’s process includes a complaint on how funding priorities are  established, how needs are assessed, the comprehensive planning process, how funds are  allocated to various service categories, the voting process, the decision-making process, and  processes regarding membership.

Eligible Grievants  

Entities directly, adversely affected by alleged deviations from Planning Council processes  related to the federal Ryan White funds. These entities are limited to:  

service providers eligible to receive Ryan White awarded funding  
infected/affected individuals  
non-funded providers
members of the public
Procedure  

The Planning Council Chair and Vice Chair will appoint six neutral Planning Council members to  review and determine whether an issue is a valid grievance that warrants a hearing to resolve  conflict that has arisen. Neutral Planning Council members must be free of any conflict of  interest with regard to the grievance case. This group will be the Grievance Committee. Nothing  in these procedures is to be interpreted as giving the Chair and Vice Chair the responsibility to  protect any agency, the administrative agency, or the funding process. The procedure shall be  applied in such a way as to assure a fair opportunity for presenting and resolving the complaints  and grievances of the grievant. For definitions of terms used in this document, please see the  attached list. A grievant shall not be discriminated against nor suffer retaliation as a result of  filing a grievance in good faith, nor as a result of participation in the investigation of a  grievance.  

Committee Conflict of Interest  
A member of the Grievance Committee must be free of an apparent conflict of  interest in order to participate in a particular grievance proceeding. If there is an  apparent conflict of interest, the members in conflict must remove themselves
from participating in the grievance procedure relating to the grieving party. The  Grievance Committee may vote to exclude a member if apparent conflicts are  raised by the grieving party.  

A member has a conflict of interest if the member is affiliated with the grieving  party. Affiliation is defined as, but is not limited to, staff member, board  member, volunteer, contractor, or owner.  
Representation  
In exercising the rights and remedies under this grievance procedure, grievants  may present a grievance, either individually or through a representative. The  representative may assist grievants in the preparation of their written grievance  and present the grievance at the grievance hearing. However, nothing in these  procedures requires the Executive Committee to send its written responses to or  a notice on a grievance to a grievants representative rather than the grievant.  
While the grievants are free to have a representative of their choice, there is no  provision for the Planning Council- to pay compensation to or reimburse the  expenses of a representative.  
Grievants electing representation must designate their representative in writing  on the grievance form at the time the grievance is filed. In all cases, all parties,  including the representative, must conduct themselves in a professional manner  and afford the persons present due respect. The failure to do so shall be grounds  to terminate the grievance hearing, in which case the grievance will be decided  on the basis of the written grievance and the information obtained prior to the  termination of the hearing. Repeated or gross misconduct by an individual shall  also be grounds to disqualify that individual from participating in future  grievance hearings.  
Grievance Steps  
All grievances must be submitted in writing within 30 days of the occurrence that  gave rise to the grievance or within 30 calendar days of their first learning of the  occurrence if it was not reasonable for them to have had knowledge of the  occurrence. If grievants anticipate relying on the testimony of witnesses to  support their grievance, they shall list the witnesses and give a brief summary of  their testimony as an attachment to the grievance form. The grievance form is to  be used by the grievants and the Executive Committee in all grievance  procedures.  
Grievants must submit the signed, completed, original grievance form to the  Planning Council Office within 30 calendar days of the occurrence giving rise to  the grievance or within 30 calendar days of their first learning of the occurrence  if it was not reasonable for them to have had knowledge of the occurrence  sooner.  
When a grievance is filed against the Planning Council’s decisions or over  continuing conditions, the Planning Council Support Staff shall send a copy of the  filed grievance to the Planning Council Chair and Vice Chair, the Administrative
Agency, and any other party named in the grievance. The steps will be conducted  as follows:  

The grievance form shall be filed with the Planning Council Support Staff  within 30 calendar days of the initial occurrence.  
The Planning Council Support Staff shall send a copy of the filed grievance  to the involved parties, Chair and Vice Chair of the Planning Council, and  the Administrative Agency within 10 working days of receiving the filed  grievance.  
iii. The Planning Council Chair and Vice Chair will appoint the six member  Grievance Committee to vote, and participate in the grievance process.  All six members will be neutral parties to the complaint.

After receiving the grievance, the Grievance Committee Chair shall  schedule the date for a hearing within 10 working days of receiving the  grievance and shall notify the grievant of the time and the place. There  must be a hearing by the Grievance Committee before a  recommendation for resolution is made. All efforts must be made for a  speedy resolution and of the grievance. If so noted, the Grievance  Committee will take transportation issues into consideration when  selecting a location.  
Grievants may elect to present their grievance individually or to have a  representative present the grievances during the hearing.  
The Grievance Committee will respond in writing to the grievance within  5 working days after the hearing.  
vii. The Grievance Committee shall recommend a resolution to the Planning  Council and the grievants.  

viii. The decision of the Grievance Committee shall be reviewed by the  Planning Council.  

If, after the Planning Council acts on the recommendation by the  Grievance Committee, the grievant is dissatisfied with the action of the  Planning Council, the grievant may file an appeal to the Planning Council  within 5 working days of receiving the Planning Council’s decision.  
An appeal to the Planning Council in the form of a letter must be filed  within 10 working days of the Planning Council’s action.  
The Planning Council will then contact one of the pre-selected arbitrators  from the American Arbitration Association to meet with both parties. xii. The arbitrator has 5 working days after the conclusion of the arbitration  hearing to render a decision.
xiii. The Planning Council shall act upon the arbitrator’s decision at the next  Planning Council meeting whenever possible.

xiv. The decision of the arbitrator is final and completes the Planning  Council’s grievance procedure.

Grievance Hearing Rules of Conduct  

The Grievance Committee is required to allow grievants adequate time to fully  present their issues and receive answers to their inquiries.  
The grievance participants are encouraged to dialogue with one another and all  members of the Grievance Committee. The hearing is not to be set up as an  adversarial process.  
The grievant or the Grievance Committee may request persons be present to  witness the proceedings, especially the Administrative Agency’s staff and Planning  Council Committee Chairs.  
If witnesses are called, the witness shall be questioned while the grievance  participants are present.  
General Provisions

All of the time limits set forth in this grievance procedure may be extended by  mutual consent; however, the mutual consent must be in writing.  
The grievance shall be considered closed if the Planning Council’s action on the  grievance is not appealed within the time limit or mutually agreed extension  thereof.  
The Grievance Committee shall base its recommendation on the evidence presented  either at the hearing, or in the written grievance, or both.  
The Grievance Committee shall have broad discretionary authority to investigate the  grievance.  
Witnesses  

Grievants may send a list of requested witnesses to the Grievance Committee Chair.  The Chair is responsible for inviting the requested witnesses or representatives of  the witnesses to the hearing.  
The Chair has the authority to deny a request for a witness to be present. The  grievant may raise the denial of the request at the grievance hearing for the  Grievance Committee to consider.  
Planning Council members are encouraged to serve as witnesses and provide  statements for the grievant and the Grievance Committee when requested to do so.  
Confidentiality  

Members of the Grievance Committee and any support staff shall sign  confidentiality statements to ensure that the information gathered in the  investigative process is held in confidence.  
Recordings  

The grievance procedure is intended to be a problem-solving process for addressing grievances.  The use of recorders in the grievance process creates a format and adverse atmosphere that is  in direct conflict with the purpose of the problem-solving approach. Recording (and reporters)  may not be used in the grievance process including. As reasonable accommodation for a  physical or mental impairment, a grievant may use a qualified interpreter or a recorder.

Open Records  

Once a grievance is filed, the grievant is entitled to review documents to support the  grievant’s claim and prepare for the hearing. The grievant must provide in writing a  list of the documents requested. The request must be sent to the Planning Council  Support Staff at which point it will be forwarded to the Chair of the Executive  Committee. The Executive Committee will coordinate the Open Records request  with the Administrative Agency.  
The grievant shall be given the opportunity to review the documents requested at  the Administrative Agency’s office.  
Any requests for open records must be subject to the Open Public Records Act,  N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1 et seq.
Failure to Appear  

Barring exceptional circumstances, if the grievant fails to appear without notice to the  Executive Committee at a scheduled hearing, no further action will be taken on the grievance.
